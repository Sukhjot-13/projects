          <p class="first">
            <!-- Info about the company is added here-->
            Welcome to Xperience, where reality takes a backseat, and the
            extraordinary becomes your new normal. Our story began in the
            bustling streets of a futuristic city, where a group of dreamers and
            visionaries came together with a shared passion for redefining human
            experiences.
          </p>
          <p>
            In the early days, our founder, Dr. Evelyn Quantum, a brilliant
            scientist with a penchant for pushing boundaries, stumbled upon a
            mysterious artifact during an expedition to the uncharted corners of
            the world. This artifact, a relic from an ancient civilization, held
            the key to unlocking new dimensions of reality.
          </p>
          <p>
            Inspired by the possibilities, Dr. Quantum gathered a team of
            experts from diverse fields virtual reality, neuroscience, art, and
            gaming- forming the nucleus of what would later become Xperience.
            Fuelled by a collective desire to break free from the constraints of
            the ordinary, they embarked on a journey to blend cutting-edge
            technology with the boundless realms of human imagination.
          </p>
          <p>
            Years of tireless experimentation and innovation led to the creation
            of the Quantum Sphere, a revolutionary device that transcended the
            boundaries of traditional virtual reality. The Sphere seamlessly
            merged the digital and physical worlds, allowing users to step into
            realms previously confined to the realm of dreams.
          </p>
          <p>
            Xperience quickly gained recognition for its groundbreaking
            contributions to the world of virtual reality, attracting a
            community of adventurers, creators, and thrill-seekers eager to
            explore the uncharted territories of the human mind.
          </p>
          <p>
            As our community grew, so did our commitment to pushing the limits
            of what was once thought impossible. Xperience evolved into a hub of
            creativity and innovation, hosting events, challenges, and
            collaborative projects that brought together the brightest minds in
            the field.
          </p>
          <p>
            Today, Xperience stands as a testament to the power of imagination
            and the relentless pursuit of the extraordinary. Join us on this
            exhilarating journey as we continue to redefine reality, one
            immersive experience at a time. Together, let's Xperience the
            extraordinary.
